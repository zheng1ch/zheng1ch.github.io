  abstract = {Navigating space and forming memories based on spatial experience are crucial for survival, including storing memories in an allocentric (map-like) framework and conversion into egocentric (body-centered) action. The hippocampus and parietal cortex (PC) comprise a network for coordinating these reference frames, though the mechanism remains unclear. We used a task requiring remembering previous spatial locations to make correct future action and observed that hippocampus can encode the allocentric place, while PC encodes upcoming actions and relays this to hippocampus. Transformation from location to action unfolds gradually, with “Came From” signals diminishing and future action representations strengthening. PC sometimes encodes previous spatial locations in a route-based reference frame and conveys this to hippocampus. The signal for the future location appears first in PC, and then in hippocampus, in the form of an egocentric direction of future goal locations, suggesting egocentric encoding recently observed in hippocampus may originate in PC (or another “upstream” structure). Bidirectional signaling is apparent between PC and hippocampus and suggests a coordinated mechanism for integrating allocentric, route-centered, and egocentric spatial reference frames at the network level during navigation.},

  abstract = {Spatial cognition research requires behavioral paradigms that can distinguish between different navigational elements, such as allocentric (map-like) navigation and egocentric (e.g., body centered) navigation. To fill this need, we developed a flexible experimental platform that can be quickly modified without the need for significant changes to software and hardware. In this paper, we present this inexpensive and flexible behavioral platform paired with software which we are making freely available. Our behavioral platform serves as the foundation for a range of experiments, and although developed for assessing spatial cognition, it also has applications in the nonspatial domain of behavioral testing. There are two components of the software platform, “Maze” and “Stim Trigger.” While intended as a general platform, presently both programs can work in conjunction with Neuralynx and Open Ephys electrophysiology acquisition systems, allowing for precise time stamping of neural events. The Maze program includes functionality for automatic reward delivery based on user defined zones. “Stim Trigger” permits control of brain stimulation via any equipment that can be paired with an Arduino board. We seek to share our software and leverage the potential by expanding functionality in the future to meet the needs of a larger community of researchers.},

  abstract = {The behavior of spin systems on curved geometries offers a unique window into the interplay between topology and statistical mechanics. This study employs extensive Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase transitions of the 2D Ising model mapped onto hyperbolic lattices (Poincaré disk). We utilize the Wolff cluster algorithm to overcome critical slowing down near the phase transition temperature. Our results indicate that the critical exponents on negatively curved surfaces deviate significantly from the standard Onsager solution for flat Euclidean lattices. Specifically, we observe a suppression of the correlation length divergence, suggesting a mean-field-like behavior induced by the exponential expansion of the lattice volume. These findings have implications for understanding quantum gravity models and holographic duality.},
