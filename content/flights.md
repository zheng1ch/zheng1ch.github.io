I like traveling and love to record, including flights, trains, road trips, tickets, etc..

For example, here is an overview of all my flights (last updated: 2025/12):

All flights are also recorded on Myflightradar24, with more detailed stats and an interactive map. [You can view it here:](https://my.flightradar24.com/zhengych)

I wish it could be embedded but looks like they do not allow it, or I just haven't figured out how yet.
